### Hello HENNGE!

My name is Charles Liu and I am a full stack web developer hailing from California. I've been living and working in Tokyo for about 1.5 years now and I absolutely love the people, the food, the culture, and emerging tech scene. I was a graduate from the immersive coding bootcamp Code Chrysalis where I learned how to create full web applications using modern frameworks and have been polishing my skills at my current start up for a year now. One thing that I love about being an alumni of this bootcamp is the connection I have to meet new people in the tech sphere of Tokyo as it continues to grow with more engineers by the day. I also have the pleasure of teaching first time programmer how to code in Javascript as part time jobs.

One thing that got me really interested in HENNGE is your stance on being early adopters of new technologies despite the chance failures. It shows me that you are willing to take risks to find the next best technological solution and that failure to you is not the end of the process but part of the process, just like any Agile and iterative working environment. I want to be part of the frontier of developers trying new technologies and implementing new solutions to improve both my individual skills but also increase the capabilities of the Tokyo tech scenes.

In this HENNGE Admissions Challenge, I challenged myself to not just create this application, but also do it in Typescript, which I am proficient with but not fluent in. Doing so really challenged me but at the end of it, I feel very comfortable in using Typescript in all future projects. Just from your admissions test, I have learned much from you and because of that I am excited to hear more about HENNGE and what it has plans for in the future. Please let me know if you can get in touch! I would love to talk about opportunities to work with you.

Thank you very much,

Charles Liu
